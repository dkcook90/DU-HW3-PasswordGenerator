# RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR
​
## Description
​
- The motivation behind this project was to create a simple and safe way for users to create secure passwords
- I wanted to build this to truly understand how to utilize Math.random and how to manipulate strings and arrays
- This app will allow users to simply set peramiters on a password and the have a randomly generated password presented to them
- Develping this app has taught me how to break down a javascript file, understanding were variables are declared and were functions are called.
